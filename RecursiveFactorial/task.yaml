    In mathematics, the factorial of a strictly positive integer ``x``, noted :math:`x!` is defined as the product of all strictly positive integers less than or equal to ``x``. The factorial of 0 is defined as 1. Write a function that computes the factorial of a given integer x.

    Example:

    :math:`5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`
    :math:`0! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`

    Note that is essentially the same question as one that was asked in the first session, except that we now expect you to solve it differently. The use of ``while`` and ``for`` loops will be prohibited and you are expected to solve it by writing a recursive function.
    We also want you to return ``None`` whenever the factorial cannot be computed.
