    You are still working on your next big game, God of massive destruction Game Of The Century edition, and now you need to implement a basic combat system.
    For this exercice, you will need to implement three classes : Character, Cratos and Drauf.

    Cratos and Drauf will inherit from Character.

    The Cratos class represent the player, and the Drauf is a basic ennemy.

    the Character class will have to have the attributes life and attack_point, and the functions attack and get_hit.

    The Cratos class also have an attribute experience and a function gain_XP.

    Cratos starts with 100 life, 10 damage and 0 experience. The Drauf will have its variables set with the constructor.

    The function attack will get an Character, and will have to call the function get_hit of this object, with its attack_point in parameter.

    The function get_hit will reduce the life of the object by the damage.

    The function gain_XP will increase the XP of the player by the amount in parameters. Every 10 point of experience, the damage of Cratos will increase by 1 (the amount of XP gain can be higher than 10; be careful to take that in account)

            You have to implement the following :

            the class Character

            .. code-block:: python

              #attributes
              life
              attack_point

              #functions
              attack(target)
              get_hit(damage)

            the class Cratos

            .. code-block:: python

              #attributes
              experience

              #functions
              __init__()
              gain_XP(amount)

            the class Drauf

            .. code-block:: python

              #functions
              __init__(life, damage)
