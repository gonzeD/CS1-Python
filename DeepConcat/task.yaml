    Suppose we have a multi-level depth list of which the elements are all strings.

    *Example*: ["a",["b","6"],"e",["5",["g","h"]],"i"]

    Create a function deepconcat(l) that traverses this structure and creates a new string which is the concatenation of all the strings appearing in that structure.

    *Example*:
    deepconcat(["a",["b","6"],"e",["5",["g","h"]],"i"])
    => returns "ab6de5ghi"
