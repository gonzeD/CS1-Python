    `Anonymous <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)>`_ was dazzled by your work and decided to entrust you with the analysis of the whole bunch of data they intercepted.

    With the help of the  two functions you already designed, you will transform each line of the data into a pattern and extract the number of occurence it can be found in the file.

    Create a function ``collect(data)`` to read the file extract the patterns and store them in a dictionary with their occurrences.

    In case of error, just return a string with the name of the error.

    *Reminder*:

    - ``extract(code)``: gives the nature of each element of a string.

    - ``treatment(code)``: transform a suite of elements into a pattern.
