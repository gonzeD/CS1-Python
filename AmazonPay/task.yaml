    As the manager of the Amazon Dispatch center, you also have to pay your -slaves- employees.

    To do so, you have to create a function pay_employees, that take an employee in parameter and the number of hours it has worked.

    you then have to call the function receive_salary of the object employee with the argument hours_worked multiplied by the pay of the employee (an attribute of the object)



    The problem is that you know the data could have some problems. So you decide to create custom exception to take in account all possible problems.

    You have to create (and raise them if necessary) the following exceptions :

    * EmployeeDidntWorked : if the employee has worked 0 hours
    * EmployeeWorkedNegatively : if the employee worked less than 0 hours (Yes, the data can have weird problems)
    * EmployeeWorkedTooMuch : if the employee worked more than possible (24*31 = 744 hours)
    * PayIsNegative : if the pay of the employee is negative
    * PayIsTooBig : if an employee has a pay per hour bigger than 100$

            Implement the 5 custom error and the function pay_employees(employee, hours_worked)

            The class employee is already implemented, and look like this :

            .. code-block:: python

              # attributes
              pay # the salary per hour

              # functions
              receive_salary(much) # receive salary of the month
