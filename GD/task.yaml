    The Greatest Divisor of a number ``a`` is the biggest number ( except ``a`` itself) such that the division of ``a`` by this natural is an entire division.

    Since \\(0\\) is divisible by any natural this may cause some problems if you will look for the bigger one, so we expect you to return ``None``.

    Recall that the operator ``%`` returns the remainder of the Euclidian division.
