    Since your work was quite remarkable, `Anonymous <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)>`_ contacted you again with another dangerous task. They're short-handed and would like you to treat the data you've been providing them.

    They want you to build a a function that will transform your precedent ouput into something easier and quickier to process. It is up to you to transform the data into an usable pattern!

    Create a function ``treatment(data)`` to transform the data you previously returned into a pattern:

    Each suite of common elements should be indicated by the nature of the element followed by '*' and its occurence without other elements in between.

    *Example*:

    With the code ``'66AeB7'`` your precedent function would output 'number number vowel-up vowel-low consonant-up number'.

    With this output as input ``treatment`` would output the string 'number*2 vowel-up*1 vowel-low*1 consonant-up*1 number*1'

    Do not hesitate to use as many submethods as you judge necessary.
