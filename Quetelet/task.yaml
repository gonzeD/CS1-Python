    The `Body mass index (BMI) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index>`_ or Quetelet index, used by dieticians, is indicative of the condition of a person.

    A normal person should have an index between 20 and 25. Below 20, she is considered thin, above 25 overweight.
    Beyond 30, the person is obese!

    This index is calculated as the ratio between a person's weight, expressed in kg, and the square of the person's height, expressed in meters.

    Create a function ``quetelet(height, weight)`` to calculate a person's Quetelet index and return ``thin`` string for a person with an index strictly less than 20, ``normal`` for a person whose index is between 20 and 25, ``overweight`` if the index is strictly greater than 25 and less than or equal to 30 and ``obese`` when it is strictly greater than 30.
