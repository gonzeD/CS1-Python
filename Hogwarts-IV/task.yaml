    The rules of *Quidditch* were established in 1750 by the **Department of Magic Games and Sports**. And it is nowhere said that the referee can't use a bit of help.

    **Madam Hooch** is quite busy already looking for *blatching*, *blurting*, *blagging* and many other nasty quidditch faults. So she thought you could design a program that would decide the winner of a match based on the list of the points.

    The scores list would be provided as a file. The content of this file would follow this format:

    - Two first lines: **Names of the teams**
    - Lines after: **Team_scoring** *points*

    In case of error, just raise it.

    Remember that the catch of the *golden snitch* (150 points) means the end of the match.
