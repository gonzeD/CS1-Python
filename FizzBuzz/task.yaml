    Write a program allowing to play the game `fizzbuzz <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz>`_.
    You receive a number (stored in variable ``i``).
    We will implement a simplified version of the game. For a given integer ``i``, the game will :

    - Store the string "``fizz``" in the variable ``temp`` if the number is divisible by  3.
    - Store the string "``buzz``" in the variable ``temp`` if the number is divisible by 5.
    - Store the string "``fizzbuzz``" in the variable ``temp`` if the number is divisible by 3 and by 5.
    - Store the string "``no``" in the variable ``temp`` if the number is not divisible by 3 nor by 5.

    .. code-block:: python

        i = ...    # the number to check (i >= 1)
        temp = ... # "fizz", "buzz", "fizzbuzz" or "no" depending on i's value
