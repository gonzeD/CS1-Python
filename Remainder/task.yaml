    Suppose the variables ``a`` and ``b`` contain a natural number.

    Write a code fragment that assigns the remainder of their division in the variable ``rest``.

    To implement your solution, use only a ``while`` loop and subtractions (the simple solution rest = a % b is not allowed; we want to test if you are capable of implementing such an operation yourself).

    Note that you should not allow division by 0 and assign the value ``None`` to ``rest`` if this would occur.
