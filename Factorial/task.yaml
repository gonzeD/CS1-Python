    In mathematics, the factorial of a strictly positive integer ``x``, denoted as :math:`x!` is the product of all strictly positive integers less than or equal to ``x``. The factorial of 0 is defined as 1. Calculate the factorial of an integer ``x`` and store the computed value in the variable ``result``.

    *Examples*:

    * :math:`5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`

    * :math:`0! = 1`
