    In this exercise, you're asked to provide a class *Student*.

    The students are supposed to have the following characteristics:

    * A first name

    * A surname

    * A birth date

    * An email address

    * A student number (different for every student and given at the creation of the object)

    The object, when cast as a **string** should return for example:

    Student number **0**: **Herv√©** **Ducobu** born the **1st of april**, can be reached at **doNotReachMeForHoweworks@gmail.com**

    To do so you're invited to use the magic methods.

    .. raw:: html

       <script defer>
       $(document).ready(function(){
           setTimeout(function() {
           window.parent.postMessage({height: document.body.scrollHeight}, "*");
        }, 0);
       })
       </script>
