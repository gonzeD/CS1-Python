    The police is hiring you to develop a program to calculate the fine that a car driver will have to pay in the event of a violation. The law stipulates that the driver will have to pay 5 euros per km/h above the maximum authorized speed, with a minimum fine of 12.5€.

    For any speeding of more than 10 km/h above the authorized speed, the fine is doubled!

    Your program takes as input the maximum allowed speed and the actual speed of the car. It calculates the possible fine.

    *Example*:

    - If the maximum speed is 50km/h and the vehicle is traveling at 62km/h, the penalty will be 12 * 5 * 2 = 120€.

    - If the maximum speed is 50km/h and the vehicle is traveling at 56km/h, the penalty will be 6 * 5 = 30€.

    - If the maximum speed is 50km/h and the vehicle is traveling at 51km/h, the fine will be 12.5€.
