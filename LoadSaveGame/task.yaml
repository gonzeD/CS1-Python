    For your next big game, God of massive destruction Game Of The Century edition, you have to create a function to load and to save the data of the player.

    .. raw:: html

       <script defer>
       $(document).ready(function(){
           setTimeout(function() {
           window.parent.postMessage({height: document.body.scrollHeight}, "*");
        }, 0);
       })
       </script>

          You have to create two function, one to save the data and one to load the data previously saved.
          You are free to store the data like you want in the file, but putting one integer per line is probably the easiest.
          If there is no file to load when using the function load_data (for exemple, the player starts a new game), you must raise a FileNotFoundError.

          The two function will have these definition :

          .. code-block:: python

              #save the 4 integer to the file named filename
              def save_data(filename, life, mana, position_x, position_y)

              #return a tuple containing (life, mana, position_x, position_y) previously saved
              def load_data(filename)
