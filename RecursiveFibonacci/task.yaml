    In mathematics, the `Fibonacci series <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number>`_ are the numbers in the following sequence of integers, which are characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones:

    Example: :math:`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...`

    A very simple algorithm would be:
    $$\\text{F}_0 = 0$$
    $$\\text{F}_1 = 1$$
    $$\\text{F}_n = \\text{F}_{n-1} + \\text{F}_{n-2}$$

    Adapt the function which you implemented in session 3 to create a recursive solution to this exercise. You should also return ``None`` in the case of an incongruous input.
