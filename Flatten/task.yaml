    In Python, we can store many kinds of elements in a list, including lists themselves.

    *Example*: :math:`[1,[2, 3], 4,[5, [6, 7]], 8]`

    Such structures are hard to read for a program, however, and often need to be flattened to a simple one-level depth list before. The flattened version of the list above would be: :math:`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`

    Create a function ``flatten(l)`` that returns a one-level depth list from a multi-level depth list.
