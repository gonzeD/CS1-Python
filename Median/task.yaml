    Suppose the variables ``a``, ``b`` and ``c`` contain a natural number.

    Write a code fragment that assigns to the variable ``median`` the median value of these numbers.

    As a reminder, the median of three values is the value such that there is exactly one value lower than (or equal to) it and one value higher than (or equal to) it.
