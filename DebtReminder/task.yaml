    You and your friends offend lend each other money.
    Rather than using convenient applications to remember who owes how much money to who,
    you decide to make your own Python program for this task.

    Specifically, you would like to have a way to

    * tell who owes money to whom;

    * change the money count when someone pays someone else back or when someone lends money to someone else;

    * add a person that borrows and/or lends money;

    * compute the sum of all the money currently borrowed.

    Note that at all times, any money lent to someone should be borrowed by the lender.
    In other words, if *Woody* has lent *3€* to *Buzz*, your program should say that *Buzz owes 3€ to Woody* and that *Woody owes -3€ to Buzz*.

        }, 0);

        $(window).resize(function(){
            window.parent.postMessage({height: document.body.scrollHeight}, "*");
        });
       })

            To do this, you will use a dictionary of dictionaries called ``borrowed_money``, indexed by the names of the people (as strings).
            The first index will be the name of the "borrower"; the second the name of the "lender".

            For example, if *Woody* has lent *3€* to *Buzz*, your dictionary should be as follows:

            .. code-block:: python

                borrowed_money["Buzz"]["Woody"] == 3  # Read "Buzz owes Woody 3€"
                borrowed_money["Woody"]["Buzz"] == -3

            Consequently, you can get a dictionary which contains all the money Buzz borrows anyone:

            .. code-block:: python

               borrowed_money["Buzz"] == {"Woody": 3, "Hamm": 60, "Rex": -5}

            Make a function ``give_money(borrowed_money, from_person, to_person, amount)``
            which would be called when ``from_person`` gives ``amount`` € to ``to_person``
            (either because ``from_person`` lends money to ``to_person`` or because they pay back the money they borrowed).
            If any of the 2 people aren't already keys in the dictionary, they should be added to it.
            You should raise a ``ValueError`` in case someone tries to give money to themself.

            Make another function ``total_money_borrowed(borrowed_money)``
            which will return the total amount of money borrowed at that time in the group
            (that is, the sum of the positive amounts of money in the dictionaries).

            *Note: you should raise a* ``ValueError`` *if any of the arguments fed to those functions
            are invalid (i.e. if names are not strings, if* ``borrowed_money`` *is not a dictionary or if the amount of money is not an integer or a float).
            You can test if a variable is of the right type in the following way:*

            .. code-block:: python

               variable = 5
               type(variable) == int  # returns True
               # OR
               isinstance(variable, int)  # returns True

            Finally, implement the example that Mark lends Bill and Steve 2 000 000€,
            Serguei lends Bill 5 000 000€, Bill lends Larry 6 000 000€ and Larry lends Linus 5.5€.
            Then, Steve pays Mark back. This should be using the variable ``borrowed_money``.
