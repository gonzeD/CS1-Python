    The Greatest Common Divisor of two natural numbers ``a`` and ``b`` is the biggest natural number ``k`` such that the division of ``a`` and ``b`` by this natural ``k`` is an entire division.

    Euclid found a very simple recursive algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers:
    $$\\text{gcd}(a,0) = a$$
    $$\\text{gcd}(a,b) = \\text{gcd}(b,a\\%b)$$

    Recall that the operator ``%`` returns the remainder of the euclidian division.
