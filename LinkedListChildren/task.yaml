    You are the manager of a vacation camp. To make sure you don't lose any children in your visit of a local forest, every children must look to a buddy, which will look to another buddy, etc. Until every child has a buddy and is the buddy of someone.
    You are sure that if you take a children, and follow the trail of buddy, you will visit all children.
    To check if every child is here, you just need to check that every children has his buddy, and check that for all children.

          You have to check if every children is here. To do so, you have acces to the first child, in the variable first_child of the class Child (that is a valid Child). the class Child has the function isNextValid to check if it has his buddy, and the function nextChild to get his buddy.

          .. code-block:: python

              class Child:
                  def is_next_valid() #return a boolean
                  def next_child() #return a Child


          Don't forget to stop checking once you have checked every child.
          You have to complete the body of the function, and return true if all the children are here, and false if not
